In computer programming, a comment is text embedded in source code that a translator (compiler or interpreter) ignores. Generally, a comment is an annotation intended to make the code easier for a programmer to understand â€“ often explaining an aspect that is not readily apparent in the program (non-comment) code. For this article, comment refers to the same concept in a programming language, [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), configuration file and any similar context. Some development tools, other than a source code translator, do [parse comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) to provide capabilities such as API document generation, static analysis, and version control integration. The [syntax of comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Comments) varies by programming language yet there are repeating patterns in the syntax among languages as well as similar aspects related to comment content.

The flexibility supported by comments allows for a wide degree of content style variability. To promote uniformity, style conventions are commonly part of a [programming style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style) guide. But, best practices are disputed and contradictory.
