In computer programming, a comment is text embedded in source code that a translator (compiler or interpreter) ignores. Generally, a comment is an annotation intended to make the code easier for a programmer to understand – often explaining an aspect that is not readily apparent in the program (non-comment) code. For this article, comment refers to the same concept in a programming language, [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), configuration file and any similar context. Some development tools, other than a source code translator, do [parse comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) to provide capabilities such as API document generation, static analysis, and version control integration. The [syntax of comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Comments) varies by programming language yet there are repeating patterns in the syntax among languages as well as similar aspects related to comment content.

The flexibility supported by comments allows for a wide degree of content style variability. To promote uniformity, style conventions are commonly part of a [programming style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style) guide. But, best practices are disputed and contradictory.

### Features:
* Remove Comments : Pascal, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML, Python
* Highlight Code in different Styles
* Compress Code

Support for code comments is defined by each programming language. The features differ by language, but there are several common attributes that apply throughout.

Most languages support multi-line block (a.k.a. stream) and/or single line comments. A block comment is [delimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Bracket_delimiters) with text that marks the start and end of comment text. It can span multiple lines or occupy any part of a line. Some languages allow block comments to be recursively nested inside one another, but others do not. A line comment ends at the end of the text line. In modern languages, a line comment starts with a delimiter but some older languages designate a column at which subsequent text is considered comment. Many languages support both block and line comments – using different delimiters for each. For example, C, C++ and their many derivatives support block comments delimited by /* and */ and line comments delimited by //. Other languages support only one type of comment.

###  C++ Example:

Comments can explain the author's intent – why the code is as it is. Some contend that describing what the code does is superfluous. The need to explain the what is a sign that it is too complex and should be re-worked.

* "Don't document bad code – rewrite it."
* "Good comments don't repeat the code or explain it. They clarify its intent. Comments should explain, at a higher level of abstraction than the code, what you're trying to do."

### Delimiter:
In computing, a delimiter is a [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) or a sequence of characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent regions in data such as a text file or data stream. For context, data boundaries can be indicated via other means. For example, [declarative notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal#Declarative_notation) indicates the length of a field at the start of the field instead of relying on delimiters.

Delimiters are used for a wide range of purposes. The following examples demonstrate a small fraction of their applicability.

### Bracket delimiters:
Bracket delimiters, also called block delimiters, region delimiters, or balanced delimiters, mark the start and end of a region of text. Commonly used bracket delimiters include:

| Delimiters | Description |
| :-----------: | :------------ |
| ( )     | [Parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses); [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) is cited as recognizable by its use of parentheses |
| { }     | Braces; also called [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Curly_brackets) |
| [ ]     | Square brackets; commonly used to denote a subscript |
| < >     | [Angle brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets) |
| " "     | Double [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark); commonly used to denote a [string literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal) |
| ' '     | Single quote; commonly used to denote a string literal or [character literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_literal) |
| <? ?>   | Used in [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) to denote a [processing instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_Instruction) |
| /* */   | Used in many [programming languages]}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) to denote a [comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)) |
| <% %>   | Used in some [web templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system) to specify a language boundary |

### How can I integrate my own programming language:
To add an additional programming language, a few steps are required.
* Create a *.pas file named, for example, ```VisualBasic.pas``` and copy the contents of the ```pascalDeleter.pas``` file into your file and renames the unit.
* Then the procedure and the function must be renamed.
```pascal
procedure PAS_SetProgression(Eventer:TPurifyEvent);
   function PAS_NoComments(RE:TStrings):real;

.. in ..

procedure PAS_SetProgressionVisualBasic(Eventer:TPurifyEvent);
   function PAS_NoCommentsVisualBasic(RE:TStrings):real;
```
Which must be called in the main unit

* Then the comments must be added to the characters that should be deleted
```pascal
// Here everything in the area of ​​the bracket with a star is deleted
          if L2='(*' then
            begin
              r:=L1;
              Comment:=true;
              Key:=true;
              Continue;
            end;

          if Key then
            L2:=Copy(s,x-1,2);
          if (Comment) and (L2='*)') then
            begin
              Comment:=false;
              Key:=false;
              r:=L1;
              Continue;
            end;

// Here everything after the specified string is deleted, in this case //
          if L2='//' then
            begin
              CmtLine:=true;
              r:=L1;
              Continue;
            end;
```

* The command must then be renamed and executed in the main unit.
```pascal
   PAS_SetProgressionVisualBasic(Progression);
   PerCent := PAS_NoCommentsVisualBasic(RichEdit1.Lines);
```

### How can I change the highlight colors:
To change the highlight colors, open the ```Highlight.pas``` file and modify the following sections.

In these sections, you can define the symbols or commands for highlighting.
Note: When adding or removing commands, the loop in the lower part of the code must add up to the same number of commands.

```pascal
  // symbols...
  CodeC1: array[0..20] of String = ('#','$','(',')','*',',',
          '.','/',':',';','[',']','{','}','<','>',
          '-','=','+','''','@');

  // These entries are highlighted by the style..
  // If there is a change, the loop must be adjusted
  CodeC2: array[0..44] of String = ('and','as','begin',
          'case','char','class','const','downto',
          'else','end','except','finally','for',
          'forward','function','if','implementation','interface',
          'is','nil','or','private','procedure','public','raise',
          'repeat','string','to','try','type','unit','uses','var',
          'while','external','stdcall','do','until','array','of',
          'in','shr','shl','cos','div');
```
