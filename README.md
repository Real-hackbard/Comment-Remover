In computer programming, a comment is text embedded in source code that a translator (compiler or interpreter) ignores. Generally, a comment is an annotation intended to make the code easier for a programmer to understand – often explaining an aspect that is not readily apparent in the program (non-comment) code. For this article, comment refers to the same concept in a programming language, [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), configuration file and any similar context. Some development tools, other than a source code translator, do [parse comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) to provide capabilities such as API document generation, static analysis, and version control integration. The [syntax of comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Comments) varies by programming language yet there are repeating patterns in the syntax among languages as well as similar aspects related to comment content.

The flexibility supported by comments allows for a wide degree of content style variability. To promote uniformity, style conventions are commonly part of a [programming style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style) guide. But, best practices are disputed and contradictory.

### Features:
* Remove Comments : Pascal, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML, Python
* Highlight Code in different Styles
* Compress Code

Support for code comments is defined by each programming language. The features differ by language, but there are several common attributes that apply throughout.

Most languages support multi-line block (a.k.a. stream) and/or single line comments. A block comment is [delimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Bracket_delimiters) with text that marks the start and end of comment text. It can span multiple lines or occupy any part of a line. Some languages allow block comments to be recursively nested inside one another, but others do not. A line comment ends at the end of the text line. In modern languages, a line comment starts with a delimiter but some older languages designate a column at which subsequent text is considered comment. Many languages support both block and line comments – using different delimiters for each. For example, C, C++ and their many derivatives support block comments delimited by /* and */ and line comments delimited by //. Other languages support only one type of comment.

###  C++ Example:

Comments can explain the author's intent – why the code is as it is. Some contend that describing what the code does is superfluous. The need to explain the what is a sign that it is too complex and should be re-worked.

* "Don't document bad code – rewrite it."
* "Good comments don't repeat the code or explain it. They clarify its intent. Comments should explain, at a higher level of abstraction than the code, what you're trying to do."
