In computer programming, a comment is text embedded in source code that a translator (compiler or interpreter) ignores. Generally, a comment is an annotation intended to make the code easier for a programmer to understand – often explaining an aspect that is not readily apparent in the program (non-comment) code. For this article, comment refers to the same concept in a programming language, [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), configuration file and any similar context. Some development tools, other than a source code translator, do [parse comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) to provide capabilities such as API document generation, static analysis, and version control integration. The [syntax of comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Comments) varies by programming language yet there are repeating patterns in the syntax among languages as well as similar aspects related to comment content.

The flexibility supported by comments allows for a wide degree of content style variability. To promote uniformity, style conventions are commonly part of a [programming style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style) guide. But, best practices are disputed and contradictory.

Support for code comments is defined by each programming language. The features differ by language, but there are several common attributes that apply throughout.

Most languages support multi-line block (a.k.a. stream) and/or single line comments. A block comment is [delimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Bracket_delimiters) with text that marks the start and end of comment text. It can span multiple lines or occupy any part of a line. Some languages allow block comments to be recursively nested inside one another, but others do not. A line comment ends at the end of the text line. In modern languages, a line comment starts with a delimiter but some older languages designate a column at which subsequent text is considered comment. Many languages support both block and line comments – using different delimiters for each. For example, C, C++ and their many derivatives support block comments delimited by /* and */ and line comments delimited by //. Other languages support only one type of comment.

Comments can explain the author's intent – why the code is as it is. Some contend that describing what the code does is superfluous. The need to explain the what is a sign that it is too complex and should be re-worked.

* "Don't document bad code – rewrite it."
* "Good comments don't repeat the code or explain it. They clarify its intent. Comments should explain, at a higher level of abstraction than the code, what you're trying to do."
